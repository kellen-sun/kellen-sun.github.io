### Who are you?
I'm a first-year computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I'm expecting to graduate in April of 2028 and in the meantime I hope to learn as much as possible about anything and everything.
### Why do you do what you do? In other words, what keeps you going?

### Philosophically, how do you view the world? What's it all about and for?

### Outside of your responsibilities, what do you spend time on?
I like to read books, fiction and non-fiction alike, but I've been trying to read more non-fiction recently. I'm currently keeping book notes [here](https://kellensun.notion.site/kellensun/0e8a5e98906142c3a2bf753233a2e04c?v=50bd49b2d69443a69dddf9e5a10b7833). I'm working on moving those notes to this website. I also like to cube, I'm best at 2x2, but can also solve other cubes. I also like going to the gym (gotta get 'em gains). My favourite sport is soccer and was a fan of Argentina during FIFA 2022. I don't take lessons in piano or guitar, but I like playing them for fun. I'm always open to stepping out of my comfort zone and challenging myself.
### How did you make this website?
I made this website using React.js and hosted it with GitHub pages. Check out the source code [here](https://github.com/kellen-sun/kellen-sun.github.io). I hope to give credit and acknowledgement where its due, so the README.md file of this repository contains all the main resources I've used.
